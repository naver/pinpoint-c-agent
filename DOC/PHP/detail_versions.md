## The Difference between v0.1.x and v0.2.+

##  v0.1.x VS. v0.2.+

> Why do we refactor the pinpoint_c_agent (v0.1.x)?

1. Hard to support all php versions.
2. Slow, v0.1.x version hooks all functions.
3. Not support ZTS.

### Data route map

#### v0.1.x

> AOP base on zend_excuted_hook

![How does it work](../../images/principle_v0.1.x.png)
#### v0.2.+

> AOP base on classloader (like java-classloaders)

![How does it work](../../images/principle_v0.2.x.png)

#### PHP Version Compatibility

Agent version|PHP5.5.x|PHP5.6.x|PHP7.x |php-zts
----|-----|----|-----|---
v0.1.x|✔|✔|✔|✘
v0.2.+|✔|✔|✔|✔

#### PHP Framework

Framework|v0.1.x|v0.2.+
----|-----|----|
Laravel|✔|✔
ThinkPHP|✔|✔
YII|✔|✔
Workerman|✘|✔
EasySwoole|✘|✔


> Note

1. If your php application does not support composer(such as woredpress,phpwind etc), the only choice is v0.1.x.

#### Stability

`v0.2.+ > v0.1.x`


#### Maintainability(Dynamically)

```
✔: Not block user's application.
✘: Block user's application: php-fpm/apache should be restart.
```

Operation|v0.1.x|v0.2.+
----|-----|----
1.Update plugins(CRUD) |✘|✔ [How to ?](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-php-aop#how-to-reload-all-plugins)
2.Update pinpoint collector|✘|✔
3.Update pinpoint_php.so(pinpoint.so)|✘|✘


#### Performance Loss Under Stress Test

> Test Scene

```
Test Object: PHPMYAdmin
URL: http://dev-mysql-phpmyadmin/db_structure.php?server=1&db=testDB
Plugins Amount: 4
Hooked Times: 30
```

> Test Result

Case|MTT
---|----
phpmyadmin without pinpoint|387.28ms
phpmyadmin with pinpoint-php v0.1|511.46ms
phpmyadmin with pinpoint-php v0.2|398.26ms


```
MTT: Mean RTT Time

> [ pinpoint-php on Flraum test result ](./User%20Manual.md#1.1-performance-result)

> By the way, pinpoint is an APM system but not a performance enhancement system. The loss can't be avoided at present.


### Contributors' words

As composer is widely used, v0.2+ is our long-time support version, and v0.1.x could be obsoleted in the future. But we could fix some fatal error into v0.1.x.
